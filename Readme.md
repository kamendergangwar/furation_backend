# Backend API using Express.js and MongoDB

This project implements a simple RESTful API using Express.js and MongoDB. It allows you to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of items in a MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (either installed locally or using a remote MongoDB service)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install

Certainly! Here's an example README file that explains how to set up and run the project:

# Backend API using Express.js and MongoDB

This project implements a simple RESTful API using Express.js and MongoDB. It allows you to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of items in a MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (either installed locally or using a remote MongoDB service)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
## Configuration
1. Open the config/db.js file and update the MongoDB connection URL with your own MongoDB database connection string. For example:

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/my-database', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

2. Save the Changes.

## Usage
1. Start the server by running the following command:
node app.js

This will start the Express.js server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running on a specific port.

2. You can now access the API endpoints using a tool like cURL or an API testing tool like Postman. Here are the available endpoints:

GET /api/items - Retrieve all items from the database.
GET /api/items/:id - Retrieve a specific item by its ID.
POST /api/items - Create a new item in the database.
PUT /api/items/:id - Update an existing item by its ID.
DELETE /api/items/:id - Delete an item by its ID.
For example, you can use cURL to send a GET request to retrieve all items:

curl http://localhost:3000/api/items

3. Customize the code according to your specific requirements. You can modify the routes, controllers, models, and error handling as needed.

## Testing
 1. The project includes unit tests for the API endpoints using the Jest testing framework.

2. You can run the tests by running the following command:

npm test
